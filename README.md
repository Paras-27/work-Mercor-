This is my Deployed Link:

Task :

In this project, you will clone a Figma design in React. The deployed code should exactly replicate the original Figma design, including fonts, icons, colors, structure, layout, and spacing.

This is the Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/Paz2INbKkXCSR0Tqb9cmPF/Mercor-Project

Requirements:

1. Clone the Figma Design in React.

2. Implement the Kanban functionality which allows users to drag cards between columns. For example, a user might drag the “Research” card from the “To Do” column to the top of the “On Progress” column.

3. Implement responsive design techniques to ensure the application is beautiful and performant on mobile devices.

4. Deploy your React application to a hosting platform like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub pages.

5. Test the deployed application on multiple devices to verify its functionality and responsiveness.
